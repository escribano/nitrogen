nitrogen
=========

nitrogen is a simple dependency manager for Go.

It is a bash script that you should distribute with your Go package. Nitrogen 
leverages on the git, hg, and bzr versioning systems, so you don't need to distribute 
the full dependecy tree with your package, the standard gopath mechanism just 
works well. 

Set up dependencies
--------------------

Dependencies are listed in a file called 'deps' that is located in the 
same directory of nitrogen (i.e. your package root directory). Dependencies 
are formatted as "package version", where "package" is the name of the Go 
package that you need to install (e.g "golang.org/x/crypto/blowfish") and 
"version" is every suitable option for `git checkout`, `hg update` or 
`bzr revert -r`.

e.g.
```
code.google.com/p/go-uuid -c 35bc42037350
golang.org/x/crypto 4ed45ec682102c643324fae5dff8dab085b6c300
```

### Hey, I just want to freeze dependecies at the current version!

That's why nitrogen has a '-f' (--freeze) option.

```
nitrogen -f
```

You should find your dependencies listed in the generated 'deps' file.

Install dependencies
---------------------

To install a package with the required dependencies, download it with
    
```
go get -d PACKAGE
```

Then, from the package root, start nitrogen with '-i' (--install). 

```
nitrogen -i
```

Nitrogen downloads the required dependencies and installs the package with 
dependencies at the specified versions, then it restores the dependencies back 
to the default (master branch or latest version) versions. 

If you want to mantain the dependencies at the version required by your
package, instead launch it with '-i --no-clean'

```
nitrogen -i --no-clean
```

After you have done with the work on your package, restore the depencencies
at the default versions with the '-c' (--clean) option.

```
nitrogen -c
```
